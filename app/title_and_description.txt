Title: 			Calorie Calculator

Short Description: 	Calculates a calorie burn rate based on weight and MET values.

Full Description: 	This calculator will calculate the number of calories that you burn per hour based on 
			the excercise that you are doing. In order to perform the calculation, you will need to 
			determine the MET value that is associated with the excercise. MET values are a universal way of 
			ranking the intensity of an excerice, and a list of these values can be found through a variety of
			sources. A link to a table of MET values and their associated excercises is provided within the app.
		
			In addition to the MET value, you will need to enter your weight in pounds. With these two values
			the calculator can determine the number of calories that you will burn per hour.
